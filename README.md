Your red back with scratch marks, it′s my art
And I dream of losing control of my car
I remember this place as my own
Put me in a hole and then I made it my home
You say you don't mean what you say
But you′re forgetting I've been here before
pre-chorus
Pressure painted with pleasure
Sweetness bound in leather
I can keep it together
I can't keep it together!
chorus
You make me beg for the torture
Then send me home with thoughts so impure
I get it, I′ll see you around
Push my head into the pillow and tell me that you′re proud
verse
Take your chain and replace it with a name
Afraid of feeling too good, that's a shame
You say you don′t mean what you say
But you're forgetting I′ve been here before
pre-chorus
Something changed, I learned to love the pain
I can keep it together
I can't keep it together!
chorus
You make me beg for the torture
Then send me home with thoughts so impure
I get it, I′ll see you around
Push my head into the pillow and tell me that you're proud
